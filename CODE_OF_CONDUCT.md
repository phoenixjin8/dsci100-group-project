# Code of Conduct

## Goals
Our team goal is to effectively apply data wrangling and visualization strategies in order to answer a predictive question. In order to do so, we must also strive to be communicative, patient, and collaborative. We want to achieve a peer reviewed conclusion to a predictive question using the tools we learned from lecture in real practice. We want to refine our communication skills and create an environment where we can voice our perspectives for critical consideration. In addition, we would like to learn more about how to practice data science for a specified purpose through practice and application. Finally, we want to complete a satisfactory and perfect group work. 

## Expectations
For this project, we expect everyone has full attendance whenever possible with exception of emergencies. Next, checking the group chat regularly to see any new information and chats. Also, we expect everyone to do the best you can on all work. Providing constructive criticism towards other members’ ideas and resolving conflict maturely and through discussion is also expected. 

## Policies and Procedures
We agree to reach out for help when we unable to complete something by deadline and asking for help from group members and TAs if you don’t understand how to do something. Moreover, it is important to be respectful towards group members and understanding everyone has different data science background. Even with a less developed background, however, we expect everyone to be eager to learn. We also agree to keep personal life separate from group work to prevent unecessary conflict. In order to develop coding and data analysis skills, we have to attend class whenever possible and sit with group members if it is a collaboration day; however, if any emergencies occur, we will let group members know before the class. Responding appropriately to feedback and working things out together will guide us to achieve our goals. 

## Consequences
Our first step towards ensuring our expectations are met is to reach out to anyone who isn't contributing or communicating properly. If the situation cannot be resolved, then we will contact our TAs and the professor. We will rate one another at the end of the project in order to assess the level of collaboration and adherence to policies. Anyone who fails to follow the policies and procedures will face the consequences of receiving a low score or even a zero from the other group members, thus getting a lower final grade compared to those who worked and contributed.
