Title: The relationship between Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production), Mean years of schooling, Gross national income (GNI) per capita, Poverty headcount ratio at $6.85 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population) , and Life expectancy at birth

Introduction:

Provide some relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your proposal
Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project
Identify and describe the dataset that will be used to answer the question

Life expectancy is a crucial metric in assessing the wellbeing of populations, and as such, is of pertinence in both medical and socioeconomic research. Essentially, life expectancy provides the average age of death in a population, giving a more general insight into mortality (Roser, Ortiz-Ospina & Ritchie, 2013). Life expectancy began to rise in industrialized communities nearing the 19th century due to the advent of new technolgy and more advanced healthcare. Indeed, life expectancy has globally increased from 2000 to 2019, from 66.8 years in 2000 to 73.4 years in 2019 (World Health Organization, 2019). However, this increase is not truly equal - countries with lower human development have consistently reported lower life expectancies, leading to a large discrepancy in health worldwide (Roser et al., 2013).

Preliminary exploratory data analysis:
Demonstrate that the dataset can be read from the web into R 
Clean and wrangle your data into a tidy format
Using only training data, summarize the data in at least one table (this is exploratory data analysis). An example of a useful table could be one that reports the number of observations in each class, the means of the predictor variables you plan to use in your analysis and how many rows have missing data. 
Using only training data, visualize the data with at least one plot relevant to the analysis you plan to do (this is exploratory data analysis). An example of a useful visualization could be one that compares the distributions of each of the predictor variables you plan to use in your analysis.

Methods:

We will select 5 columns, Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production), Mean years of schooling, Gross national income (GNI) per capita, Poverty headcount ratio at $6.85 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population), and Life expectancy at birth. 

Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production), Mean years of schooling, Gross national income (GNI) per capita, Poverty headcount ratio at $6.85 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population) are varibales that we will use to predict Life expectancy at birth. 

We will use graphs to visualize the results

Explain how you will conduct either your data analysis and which variables/columns you will use. 
Note - you do not need to use all variables/columns that exist in the raw data set. In fact, that's often not a good idea. For each variable think: is this a useful variable for prediction?
Describe at least one way that you will visualize the results



Expected outcomes and significance:
We expect to find the relationship between the 4 factors, Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production), Mean years of schooling, Gross national income (GNI) per capita, Poverty headcount ratio at $6.85 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population), and Life expectancy at birth. 

We also expect to use the data for Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production), Mean years of schooling, Gross national income (GNI) per capita, Poverty headcount ratio at $6.85 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population) to predict Life expectancy at birth.
