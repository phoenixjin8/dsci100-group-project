    "Life expectancy, a measurement of the mean age of death in a population, is a crucial metric in assessing the wellbeing of populations, and as such, is of pertinence in both medical and socioeconomic research. Life expectancy has risen drastically in industrialized countries since the 19th century due to improvements in technology and healthcare, from 66.8 years in 2000 to 73.4 years in 2019 (World Health Organization, 2019). However, this increase is not truly equal - countries with lower human development have consistently reported lower life expectancies, leading to a large discrepancy in health worldwide (Roser et al., 2013). It is therefore important to determine what impedes or enhances the life expectancy of a population in order to improve societal conditions around the world."

    "## Expected outcomes: \n",
    "We expect to find relationships between all four of our selected socioeconomic factors and life expectancy at birth. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have increased in the atmosphere over time due to human activity. Several decades of research have indicated that rising air pollution threatens local ecosystems and human health (Balakrishnan et al., 2018). As such, we expect to find a negative relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Education has an important role in shaping society, and so will be investigated for contributions to life expectancy. Past research has indicated that higher levels of schooling lead to higher life expectancies due to more informed decisions and healthier lifestyles (Blackburn and Cipriani, 2002). Therefore, we expect to see a positive relationship between mean years of schooling and life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The gross national income represents the total financial output of a country. At a national level, a higher GNI allows more spending for public systems such as improved healthcare and sanitation. Therefore, we expect a positive relationship between GNI and life expectancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lastly, the poverty rate represents the percentage of the country's population who has less than $6.85 to spend per day, in 2017 PPP dollars. Financial poverty very often leads to social effects such as poor living conditions and limited access to housing or healthcare. We expect a negative relationship between poverty ratio and life expectancy at birth.\n"

    "## Methods: \n",
    "1. We will combine the two datasets that we selected. \n",

    "2. We will use the columns for the four variables as predictors, which are carbon dioxide emissions per capita, mean years of schooling, gross national income per capita, poverty rate, to predict life expectancy at birth\n",

    "3. We will combine countries with 'Very High' and 'High' human development indices into a 'More Developed' category, and combine countries with 'Medium' and 'Low' indices into a 'Less Developed' category.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We will perform a multivariable regression with our four factors in order to predict life expectancy at birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We will use four scatterplots to visualize our results for each of our factors with their regression lines overlaid on their respective plots. We will also create a table displaying the RMSPE of each of our regressions, to compare the predictive power of each more easily."

For more developed countries, as the gross national income increases (x value increases), the life expectancy also increases (y value increases). In comparision, for less developed countries, most of the data are on the left side of the graph with relatively low gross national income; the gross national income of less developed countries does not increase much. In addition, more developed countries covers a greater range of and have higher gross national income than less developed countries. Therefore, we conclude that there is a weak positive relationship between gross national income and life expectancy; as gross national income increases, life expectanvy also increases. "

    "- We found that life expectancy has a postive relationship with gross national income, mean years of schooling, and CO2 emissions, but a negative relationship with poverty rate. Also, more developed countries have higher life expectancy than less developed countries. \n",
    "- The majority of relationships match our predictions; we expected that life expectancy has a positve relationship with gross national income and mean years of schooling, and a negative relationship with poverty rate and CO2 emissions. However, according to our graphs, CO2 emission doesn't match our expectations, which has a positive relationship with life expectancy. \n",
    "- The main impact of these findings is to identify socioeconomic factors that contribute to life expectancy at birth and determine how gross national income, mean years of schooling, CO2 emissions, and poverty affect life expectancy at birth.\n",
    "- The future questions is how humanitarian efforts may target specific factors such as education that would have the greatest impact on extending life expectancy in less developed countries. In addition, our findings may inform other avenues of research, such as how the model for the social cost of carbon could be improved by including life expectancy as a factor.\n"
